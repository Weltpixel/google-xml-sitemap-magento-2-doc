<h1>ABOUT THE MAGENTO 2 XML SITEMAP EXTENSION FOR GOOGLE.</h1>
<p>
Our Magento 2 sitemap extension dynamically generates XML sitemaps to help search engines crawl and index your store faster!
</p>
<p>
Google has specific rules for sitemap generation settings and failing to obey them can drastically affect SEO performance. It’s essential to have your sitemaps built automatically with the help of a Magento XML sitemap generator. WeltPixel’s extension meets all search engine requirements, including Google. Plus, faster indexing of new pages will shorten the time it takes your products to appear in Google!
</p>
<p>
Our Magento sitemap generator gives you granular control over the visibility of each product, category, and CMS page within. It also allows you to add custom URLS into the sitemap - even those not included in the default Magento sitemap. You will have full control over attributes like store-view, priority, change frequency, and update date.
</p>
<p>
By using this user friendly Magento 2 extension you can dynamically exclude products, categories, and pages from the sitemap file. This is helpful for pages required in your store that you don’t want indexed by search engines.
 </p>
 <p>
<h2>Include any links in your sitemaps:</h2>
</p>
<p>
	Google XML Sitemap for Magento 2 allows to include/exclude links from various locations:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Category pages.
	</li>
	<li>
Product pages.
</li>
<li>
CMS pages.
</li>
<li>
Custom URLs.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Better sitemap reliability using advanced settings.</h2>
</p>
<p>
	You can configure detailed settings like storeview, priority, update date and change frequency. You can set the values specifically for each group of links: Products, Categories, CMS pages, and individually for each Custom URL. The more appropriate settings you have, the more Google trusts your site!

<h2 style="font-weight: 600;">HOW TO CONFIGURE THE EXTENSION</h2>
<h3>STEP 1:</h3>
<h3>HOW TO CREATE A SITEMAP IN MAGENTO?</h3>
<p>
	Go to <strong>Marketing -> SEO & Search -> Site Map</strong> and add your sitemap by clicking on <strong>"Add Sitemap"</strong> button
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Select the name for your sitemap, example: sitemap.xml
</li>
<li>
	Select the path for your sitemap, example: "/sitemap/" or "/" for base path (path must be writeable)

      <div class="col-md-6">
<h3 style="font-weight: 600;">STEP 2:</h3>
<h3>HOW TO SETUP AND CONFIGURE A SITEMAP IN MAGENTO?</h3>
<p>
	Go to <strong>Stores -> Configuration -> Catalog -> XML Sitemap</strong> and configure default settings for your sitemap.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        a. Select <strong>Frequency</strong> and <strong>Priority</strong> for each type of page in your store: <strong>Category Pages</strong>, <strong>Product Pages</strong>, CMS Pages</strong>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Frequency</h3>
	</p>
	<p>
	How frequently the page is likely to change. This value provides general information to search engines and may not correlate exactly to how often they crawl the page. Valid values are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
always / hourly / daily / weekly / monthly / yearly / never
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The value "always" should be used to describe documents that change each time they are accessed. The value "never" should be used to describe archived URLs.
</p>
<p>
Please note that the value of this tag is considered a hint and not a command. Even though search engine crawlers may consider this information when making decisions, they may crawl pages marked "hourly" less frequently than that, and they may crawl pages marked "yearly" more frequently than that. Crawlers may periodically crawl pages marked "never" so that they can handle unexpected changes to those pages.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Priority</h3>
	</p>
	<p>
	The priority of the URL relative to other URLs on your site. Valid values range from 0.0 to 1.0. This value does not affect how your pages are compared to pages on other sites—it only lets the search engines know which pages you deem most important for the crawlers. The default priority of a page is 0.5.
</p>
<p>
Please note that the priority you assign to a page is not likely to influence the position of your URLs in a search engine's result pages.
</p>
<p>
Search engines may use this information when selecting between URLs on the same site, so you can use this tag to increase the likelihood that your most important pages are present in a search index.
</p>
<p>
Also, please note that assigning a high priority to all of the URLs on your site is not likely to help you. Since the priority is relative, it is only used to select between URLs on your site.
</p>

<p>
b. Configuring sitemap generation settings
</p>
<p>
	-<strong>Enable - [ Yes / No ]</strong> - this option enable sitemap generation. Make sure cronjobs are setup on your server in order for this automated task to be triggered.
</p>
<p>
-<strong>Start time</strong> - set the time when sitemap generation should start
</p>
<p>
-<strong>Frequency</strong> - set how often you want your sitemap to be updated
</p>
<p>
-<strong>Error email recepient</strong> - configure an email where you should receive potential error reports
</p>
<p>
-<strong>Error email sender</strong> - configure store default sender of the email
</p>
<p>
-<strong>Error email template</strong> - configure store default template for the email
</p>
<p>
-<strong>Maximum No of URLs per file</strong> - set the maximum number of URLs in sitemap.
</p>
<p>
-<strong>Maximum file size</strong> - set sitemap file size in bytes
</p>
<p>
-<strong>Enable submission to Robots.txt - [ Yes / No ]</strong> - if enabled sitemap will be included in robots.txt file of your store, facilitating search engines to faster discover it.

<h3>HOW TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR MAGENTO SITEMAP USING GOOGLE XML SITEMAP?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
	a. Exclude from sitemap particular CMS Pages you do not want indexed in search engines
</li>
	<p>
		-Go to <strong>Content -> Pages -> Edit Page -> WeltPixel Options -> Exclude from Sitemap -> Yes</strong>

This option is useful when you want to exclude certain CMS Pages from sitemap. Ex: ‘404 Not Found Page’ makes no sense to be indexed by google, you do not want your customers there.

		b. Exclude from sitemap particular Product Pages you do not want indexed in search engines
	</li>
	<p>
-Go to <strong>Products -> Catalog -> Edit Product -> WeltPixel Options -> Exclude from Sitemap -> Yes</strong>
</p>
<p>
This option is useful when you want to exclude certain Product Pages from sitemap. Ex: maybe you have a lookbook where your products can be purchased using a quick view functionality and you don’t want to sell the products individually on separate product pages, in this case you can exclude that particular product pages from sitemap indexation.

</p>
<p>

d. Add custom URL to sitemap
</li>
	<p>
By default magneto doesn’t add to sitemap custom url that may be still relevant to your business, for example a html page presenting your product. Ex: Weltpixel Cleo Theme is presenation of one of our products but is not included in default Magento sitemap.
</p>
<p>
By using Google XML custom sitemap URL functionality we’ll be able to add also this link to our dynamically generated sitemap.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<p>
Go to <strong>WeltPixel -> Sitemap -> Add New Url</strong>
</p>
<strong>-URL</strong> - Insert link without base url, ex: /cleo and the link in your sitemap will be www.yourbaseurl.com/cleo
</p>
<p>
<strong>-Updated at</strong> - set the time and date when this page was last updated
</p>
<p>
<strong>-Store View</strong> - Select in what store view to insert this custom URL in sitemap
</p>
<p>
<strong>-Change Frequency</strong> - How frequently the page is likely to change. This value provides general information to search engines
</p>
<p>
<strong>-Priority</strong> - The priority of the URL relative to other URLs on your site. Valid values range from 0.0 to 1.0
</p>
<p>
<strong>-Woohoo, the sitemap is configured!</strong>
</p>
